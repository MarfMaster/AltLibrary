Alternative Biomes Library is library mod to enable the creation of alternatives to various vanilla biomes and ores, without the need for complex IL editing knowledge.

This mod is used by developers to reduce the amount of repeated code involved in the process, as well as to ensure a baseline of compatibility between multiple mods that add alternates to vanilla content.

Note that while compatibility is a goal of this library, mods which add the features it is designed to enable without using it cannot gain the benefit of that compatibility, and may resultingly be as incompatible with mods which use this as if the other mod did not use it, some incompatibility with world creation nay be resolved by using the legacy world creation interface.

Note: "secret features" and some minor menu visuals may be missing from version 1.1 and onward, as priority was given to the mod's functionality and availability as a library mod over content, these will likely not be restored, as they did not belong in a library to begin with
